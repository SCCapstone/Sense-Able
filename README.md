# What is Sense-Able?
It is sensible to use Sense-Able! (Well, you asked...)

Sense-Able is the sensible choice app to help those with visual impairments explore the world around them.  Using the LeddarTechÂ® LIDAR, Sense-Able helps you avoid walls, pillars, stairs, and more!

Currently, Sense-Able is a research demo, intended to demonstrate the concept (**See the warning below**).  With Sense-Able, you can detect obstacles using a real-time stream, detect obstacles from recorded sample files, or record your own files for testing.

# Demonstration
To see how easy it is to use Sense-Able, please watch this brief video demonstration:
