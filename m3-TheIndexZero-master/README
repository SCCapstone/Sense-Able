# Basic git routine:
git add <filename>	OR	git add *	# Add files to staging index.
git commit -m "commit message"			# Commit changes to head
						# But not yet to the remote 
						# repository.
git push origin master				# Send changes to the master branch 
						# of remote repository.

# Other git commands:
git status		# List the files you've changed and those you
			# still need to add or commit
git diff		# View all the merge conflicts between working
			# directory and remote repository.
git pull		# Fetch and merge changes on remote server to
			# working directory
