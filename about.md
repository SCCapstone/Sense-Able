### Caleb Kisby
Caleb has contributed to obstacle detection, LIDAR streaming, and sound notifications.

In his free-time, Caleb likes to sleep for 4 hours and dream about anything other than obstacle detection algorithms.  He is convinced that graph theory is fun, perhaps because it does not involve aggrivatingly wacky R squared values.
