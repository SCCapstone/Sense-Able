App is deployed using shared libraries files bundled with the applicaiton using linuxdeployqt

For full install instructions and documentation see:
https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt

Instructions: 

Download linuxdeployqt script:
  wget https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt/releases/download/continuous/linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage

Give permissions:
  chmod a+x linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage

Add Release to the path:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/PATH/TO/Sense-Able/Release:PATH/TO/Sense-Able/derp_libs


Run Script
  ./linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage /PATH/TO/leddargui -qmake=PATH/TO/QT/bin/qmake -bundle-non-qt-libs


linuxdeployqt copies all non-linux standard .so files to AppBuild/lib and plugins to AppBuild/plugins

You can determine your QT Path of your leddargui build by going to > QT Creator > Projects > Build Environment > Details and scroll to the PATH variable. The QT path will be there, mine is "/home/jms/Qt5.7.0/5.7/gcc_64/bin"

Current Issues:
	- Cannot read Leddar Data
	- Cannot do Object Detection
	- Cannot connect to Leddar
	
	- When bundling a release build it requires package versions that are inaccesible
		- zlib 1.2.9
		- libjpeg 9

	
	- LibQtserialPort.so not found -- Error went away? 
		- Remake leddar with current QT installation!


For me: 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/Documents/School/TESTSenseAble/Release:~/Documents/School/derp_libs

./linuxdeployqt-continuous-x86_64.AppImage build-leddargui-Desktop-Release/leddargui -qmake=/home/jms/Qt5.7.0/5.7/gcc_64/bin/qmake -bundle-non-qt-libs
