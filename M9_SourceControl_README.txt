This is the README for Milestone 9: Source Control due October 29.

DELIVERABLES
1.  pull from the shared repo (or clone, of course!)
2.  build,
3.  run application locally (laptop or emulator)
4.  commit to shared repo,
5.  push to the shared repo,
6.  merge your branch into master, via pull request or regular merge,
7.  and resolve a merge conflict. 

1. If you're reading this, then you've already completed Deliverable 1

2. In order to run this simulation you need to first call make in the directory. The make file expects that the share objects to be in a directory called Release, two directories up. You can just copy and paste this directory from your SDK. Because we aren't all working on linux 64 bit architecture we can't include this folder in the repository.

  Once the build is successful, call: 
      sudo ./Main Sim_1.ltl 
    OR
      sudo ./Main Sim_2.ltl

3. Make change to this file and commit the change
  Right here:
    Caleb (TheIndexZero) was here.
    Sorry, I accidentally committed under austinas because I am using his computer at the moment...
    I made the same mistake again.  I had to change the email under which I was pushing.
4. push the change

5. But before you push, merge your branch into master in order to resolve
   merge conflicts.
