### Detect Obstacles
Sense-Able uses the LeddarTechÂ® LIDAR sensor and a [pile of linear algebra](https://xkcd.com/1838/)\* to help you identify what is in front of you.  Supported obstacles include flat walls and wall corners, although we expect to support stairs, pillars, and trip hazards soon.

\*(disclaimer: no machines learn in this app)

### Live Stream
Sense-Able allows you to stream and detect obstacles in real-time, so that you can navigate the world.  A live camera feed is also provided for the researcher's convenience.  Obstacles can be detected from any user-set distance.  Sense-Able will also emit customizable audio notifications to let you know when it has found an obstacle.

### Test files
Sense-Able allows researchers to test obstacle detection using pre-recorded files!  You can also see the camera feed that was recorded alongside the data, so that you can check that the output makes sense.
